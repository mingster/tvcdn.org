# Executive Summary

Plex Media Server is an application that enables users to organize, manage, and stream their personal media collections (videos, music, photos, TV shows) to various client devices. This PRD outlines the requirements for the next iteration of Plex Media Server, focusing on better performance, broader device support, enhanced content management, and seamless user experience.

# Objective

Offer a seamless, unified platform for users to store, organize, and access personal media libraries.
Enable secure and smooth remote access.
Support a wide variety of client devices and platforms.
Provide rich metadata, media organization, and recommendation capabilities.
Introduce performance improvements and scalability enhancements for larger libraries.

# Background
Plex has established itself as a leader in personal media management. As user expectations evolve (e.g., 4K streaming, mobile offline access, AI-driven recommendations), Plex Media Server must continue innovating to stay ahead of competitors like Jellyfin, Emby, and Kodi.

# Scope

In-Scope:
- Media ingestion, scanning, and organization
- Metadata retrieval (from sources like The Movie Database, MusicBrainz)
- Streaming to web, mobile, smart TVs, and game consoles
- Remote access via Plex account
- User management and permissions
- Transcoding (dynamic, hardware-accelerated)
- Offline access/downloads
- AI-driven smart playlists and recommendations
- Plugin architecture for extensibility

Out-of-Scope:
- DRM-protected commercial streaming (handled separately via Plex Pass)
- Physical media ripping (out of compliance scope)

# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

ID	Requirement	Priority
FR1	Server must ingest media files from user-specified libraries	High
FR2	Automatic retrieval and attachment of metadata (title, cover art, descriptions)	High
FR3	Dynamic transcoding for client device compatibility	High
FR4	User authentication and secure remote access (Plex account login)	High
FR5	Allow user-defined organization (collections, tags)	Medium
FR6	Create smart playlists based on user behavior and metadata	Medium
FR7	Allow selective offline downloads (for mobile clients)	Medium
FR8	Multi-user support with view/watch history per user	High
FR9	Plugin/extension architecture to add third-party features	Low
FR10	AI-driven recommendations based on usage patterns	Medium

## Non-Functional Requirements

ID	Requirement	Priority
NFR1	Server must handle libraries with up to 1 million items efficiently	High
NFR2	Minimal server CPU/RAM usage during idle state	High
NFR3	High availability and resilience during metadata fetching	Medium
NFR4	Support hardware acceleration for transcoding (Intel QuickSync, NVIDIA NVENC)	High
NFR5	Accessible setup and installation process (5 steps or less)	High

# User Stories

- As a user, I want to upload my movies and have them automatically sorted by genre, so I can easily browse my collection.
- As a parent, I want to restrict what my child can view, so I can create a safe environment.
- As a traveler, I want to download shows to my phone, so I can watch without an internet connection.
- As a power user, I want to fine-tune transcoding settings to match my device’s capabilities.
- As a multi-device user, I want my watch progress to sync across my devices, so I can continue watching easily.

# Assumptions

- Users will have a Plex account to enable remote access features.
- Internet access is required for metadata retrieval.
- Users are responsible for legally acquiring their media content.

# Dependencies

- Metadata providers' APIs (e.g., TMDb, MusicBrainz)
- Hardware transcoding drivers and libraries
- Cloud infrastructure for account services and remote access proxy


# Success Metrics

- 95%+ success rate of accurate metadata matches.
- Sub-2 second average browsing response time for libraries <500,000 items.
- 99.9% server uptime excluding scheduled maintenance.
- User satisfaction score >90% in post-release surveys.
- 20% increase in mobile offline usage year-over-year.

# Future Considerations

- Native support for decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS integration).
- AI-driven auto-tagging of user-generated videos.
- Seamless migration paths from competing services.
- Enhanced Home Theater PC (HTPC) integration.

# Technical Architecture

## Overview

The Plex Media Server will be rebuilt (or significantly augmented) using a modern, scalable web application architecture based on:

- Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and API routes
- Prisma as the ORM layer for database interaction
- TypeScript for static type checking and improved developer productivity
- PostgreSQL (primary database for metadata and user data)
- FFmpeg for media processing and transcoding
- Redis for caching metadata and session management
- WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
- Cloudflare/Edge CDN for accelerated media delivery (optional, for remote access)
- Docker for containerized deployments
- Kubernetes (optional for enterprise/self-hosted scaling)

## Component Breakdown

Component	Technology	Description
Frontend Web Interface	Next.js + React	UI for media browsing, library management, playback controls
API Layer	Next.js API Routes	Handles CRUD operations, transcoding requests, metadata fetching
ORM/Data Access	Prisma	Type-safe database operations for users, libraries, media entries
Database	PostgreSQL	Stores user profiles, library structure, metadata references
Transcoding Engine	FFmpeg CLI	Manages on-the-fly transcoding with hardware acceleration where available
Cache	Redis	Caches popular media items, session tokens, and metadata for low-latency access
Background Workers	Next.js Edge Functions / Node.js services	Scans media libraries, fetches metadata asynchronously
Authentication	OAuth2 / JWT via NextAuth.js	Manages user login, access control, and permissions
Notifications	WebSockets / SSE	Real-time status updates (e.g., media scanning, transcoding progress)

## Key Considerations

- Scalability: Prisma connection pooling for high-volume metadata operations; Redis to cache common queries.
- Resilience: Graceful fallback mechanisms if metadata providers are unavailable.
- Extensibility: Plugin/extension system via modular Next.js API endpoints.
- Security: OAuth-based login, encrypted media link tokens for secure access.
- Performance: Static generation (SSG) for common pages, SSR for dynamic user sessions.

## Development and Deployment

- Local Development: Docker Compose stack with PostgreSQL, Redis, and local media folder mounting.
- CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions → Build → Docker Image → Deploy to AWS/GCP/Azure or on-premises Kubernetes.
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics; Sentry for error tracking.
- Media Delivery: Support direct stream when possible, fallback to dynamic transcoding if needed.
